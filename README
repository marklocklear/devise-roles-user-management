Forked from zmbmartin/devise-roles-user-management. Modify for use with sqlite rather than mongodb.

This is a quick and simple example of how you can use Devise with CanCan so an Admin(role) can manage Users.

When you use the 'Sign Up' link from the main page your user has the 'Admin' role which allows this user to create
other users. When you create a user from within the application you can set the users role as either 'Admin' or 'User'.
If they have the 'User' role then they can not create other users.
